**PingOS** is a minimalist hobbyist operating system built for the **x86_64 architecture** that boots directly into **Long Mode** and runs a single purpose: a retro **Ping Pong** game using CGA graphics. It's an educational and nostalgic project combining low-level OS development with a simple arcade-style game.
